### About me 📃
I'm 17 and I started coding when I was 13. My first lang is Python🐍. After learning basics of it I had 1-year break.  
In 2020 web development caught my attention. Firstly, I've studied HTML5 and CSS3 and started making simple web-sited (mostly small landings). The next year I became interested in SPA, especially React.js. The video course I liked most was ["React: The Way of Samuray"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8) by [Dimych IT-KAMASUTRA](https://www.youtube.com/c/ITKAMASUTRA). In 2022, when Dimych started a course of back end programming, I started learning it too. I started from Express.js and MongoDB.  
In 2023 I also had a try in C# together with Unity. I've developed a [simple game](https://github.com/ImpossiblePlayer/unity-game).  
Also I have developed full-stack todo web app using Flask, SQL-Alchemy on back end and React.js on front end.

### Currently working on...
Sinse Feb 2023 me, [Nazar @07nazar](https://github.com/07nazar) and [Kirill @Hym1ack](https://github.com/Hym1ack) are developing Ecommerce web app. My job is to develop [back end](https://github.com/ImpossiblePlayer/ecommerceBackend) with Express.js and MongoDB. And my partners are developing [front end](https://github.com/07nazar/07nazar-ecommerce) We're also planning to rewrite server with Nest.js as it provides more tools and convinience. There's also possibility to add PostgreSQL to this project.
